/*
What Is the Factory Pattern?

The Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating objects,
but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

When to use it in Fintech:
- You need to abstract the creation of notification channels (e.g., SMS, email, push)
- You want to decouple the logic that generates events (e.g., payment success) from how the event is delivered
- You want to support easy extension for more channels like WhatsApp or in-app alerts

    // Simulate a payment success event
    val userId = "e35ec78a-bd3e-4185-af57-682f37530d13"
    val paymentEvent = PaymentEvent(userId = userId, channel = NotificationType.EMAIL)
    val notification = notificationFactory.createNotification(paymentEvent.channel)

    notification.notifyUser("Payment of Â£250 was successful for user ${paymentEvent.userId}")
}
